	Comp sci has been a fun expirience so far, and I'm glad I chose it as an elective! I've had a lot of fun learning how to change the details of a website, such as font and color. These details are surprisingly easy to change. Java script seems more difficult than html, and it will be a challenge to incorporate it into my website, but I'm sure It will be worth it. I'm excited to see how complex my website can become and how I end up using the projects tab on my site!

	I've learned about html and java script at this point. I've learned the format in which websites are made an how to add things to bodies of our website. We've learned small sylistic changes, such as chaning font sizes and background colors and we've also learned more complex work such as adding event listeners. We've had a brief introduction on functions.

	I'm having trouble pushing my code, but everything else on my website is. fully updated, so hopdfully I will be able to upload it soon after I book a lab!

	I coded a website that generates different flavors of boba tea according to the optins of images. Using eventlisteners, the code responds to a click using a function by randomly choosing a variable, corresponding to an image. Linking the images was difficult at first, but after one was linked it was easy to complete the codesketch.

	I am in in the process of coding a website that generates cookies to a set timer. it is becoming difficult because although thr frunction itself is working, the image put iin place for "cookie" will not appear, and instead shows up as an undefined.

	I am coding a birthday card for my friend using an array and birthday messages. With each message i add, one more the balloon div adds to the screen. An event listener responds to clicks on each balloon and removes the balloon to reveal one message.

	I'm working on a codesketch which may end up being the one I use for my presentation. It's not too complex, so maybe i will add more. For now it's a codesketchh that responds to clicks: It changes the images and music playing corresponding to each season with if else statements.

	Write a final journal entry that's ~500 words long that's a reflection on your time in the course. 


What did you learn? 
In Comp Sci 1 I have learned the basics of the following programming languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript. Some of the things I’ve learned within these programming  languages include: functions, variables, divs, arrays, event listeners, randomizers, if then statements, for loops, and conditional statements, and code to style my webpage. 

How did you grow? 
At first I didn’t fully understand each concept I was met with and relied on typing the code at the same time as you would over zoom. Since my main focus was just replicating the code, I didn’t take the time to think about why and how everything worked. 

Eventually, as our class shifted to in person, I felt more comfortable asking questions and taking time to study and analyze your code rather than to quickly copy it. I learned

What did you like about the course? 

In this course, I like that every codesketch we did was completely customizable. I could either leave my code simple, or complicate it with additional style, add more event listeners, and functions. We were also able to tailor our codesketches/ whole entire website to a hobby/topic/interest of our choice. I also really enjoyed the class periods where we were able to just workshop as a class on pre-existing projects. This allowed me to ask questions, and experiment.

What would you want to change about it? 

I liked the in person experience a lot more than the zoom experience, and as I mentioned, I think more workshops would be beneficial. 

How do you hope to use the skills (or whatever) you learned going forward? 

I hope I can use these skills in the future when making unique gifts for family/friends, and hopefully I can use my knowledge to join next years’ comp sci courses! 

What advice would you give to future students?

I would like to tell future students to focus on the conceptual aspects of comp sci: learning how and why everything functions rather than just copying code. Especially because the code can be sent after class if needed! Also, I would encourage future students to lean into their creative side when styling codesketches because it makes the process and final product much more fun.
