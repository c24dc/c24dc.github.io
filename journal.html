	Comp sci has been a fun expirience so far, and I'm glad I chose it as an elective! I've had a lot of fun learning how to change the details of a website, such as font and color. These details are surprisingly easy to change. Java script seems more difficult than html, and it will be a challenge to incorporate it into my website, but I'm sure It will be worth it. I'm excited to see how complex my website can become and how I end up using the projects tab on my site!

	I've learned about html and java script at this point. I've learned the format in which websites are made an how to add things to bodies of our website. We've learned small sylistic changes, such as chaning font sizes and background colors and we've also learned more complex work such as adding event listeners. We've had a brief introduction on functions.
