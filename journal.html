	Comp sci has been a fun expirience so far, and I'm glad I chose it as an elective! I've had a lot of fun learning how to change the details of a website, such as font and color. These details are surprisingly easy to change. Java script seems more difficult than html, and it will be a challenge to incorporate it into my website, but I'm sure It will be worth it. I'm excited to see how complex my website can become and how I end up using the projects tab on my site!

	I've learned about html and java script at this point. I've learned the format in which websites are made an how to add things to bodies of our website. We've learned small sylistic changes, such as chaning font sizes and background colors and we've also learned more complex work such as adding event listeners. We've had a brief introduction on functions.

	I coded a website that generates different flavors of boba tea according to the optins of images. Using eventlisteners, the code responds to a click using a function by randomly choosing a variable, corresponding to an image. Linking the images was difficult at first, but after one was linked it was easy to complete the codesketch.

	I am in in the process of coding a website that generates cookies to a set timer. it is becoming difficult because although thr frunction itself is working, the image put iin place for "cookie" will not appear, and instead shows up as an undefined.

	I am coding a birthday card for my friend using an array and birthday messages. With each message i add, one more the balloon div adds to the screen. An event listener responds to clicks on each balloon and removes the balloon to reveal one message.

	I'm working on a codesketch which may end up being the one I use for my presentation. It's not too complex, so maybe i will add more. For now it's a codesketchh that responds to clicks: It changes the images and music playing corresponding to each season with if else statements.
